Speech Recognition and Translation

---

# Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

The Speech Recognition and Translation web app allows users to speak into a microphone and translate their speech into different languages using Google's Speech Recognition API and Google Translate.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Speech Recognition

- **FR-1:** The system shall capture audio input from the user's microphone.
- **FR-2:** The system shall use Google Speech Recognition to convert the captured audio into text.
- **FR-3:** The system shall handle scenarios where speech recognition fails due to unclear audio or other reasons.

### 2.2 Translation

- **FR-4:** Users shall be able to select a target language from a predefined list.
- **FR-5:** The system shall translate recognized speech text into the selected language using Google Translate API.
- **FR-6:** The translated text shall be displayed to the user.

### 2.3 User Interface

- **FR-7:** The web interface shall include a title and instructions for users.
- **FR-8:** Users shall interact with the system using a "Start Listening" button to initiate speech recognition.

## 3. Non-functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

- **NFR-1:** The system shall process speech recognition and translation within a reasonable time frame to provide a responsive user experience.
- **NFR-2:** The application shall handle multiple concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.

### 3.2 Usability

- **NFR-3:** The web interface shall be intuitive and user-friendly, guiding users on how to interact with the application effectively.

## 4. System Architecture

The application is built using Python and utilizes the following libraries:
- Streamlit for the web interface.
- SpeechRecognition for capturing and recognizing speech input.
- Googletrans for translating text into different languages.
- PyAudio for managing audio input/output.

## 5. Installation and Setup

### 5.1 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### 5.2 Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`.

## 6. Usage

- Upon running the application, select a target language and click on "Start Listening".
- Speak into the microphone when prompted.
- The recognized speech and its translation will be displayed on the interface.

## 7. Future Enhancements

- Implement additional languages for translation.
- Improve error handling and user feedback during speech recognition.

## 8. Conclusion

The Speech Recognition and Translation web app provides a convenient way for users to interact with real-time speech recognition and translation capabilities, enhancing multilingual communication.
